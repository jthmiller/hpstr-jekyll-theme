# HPSTR Jekyll Theme

They say three times the charm, so here is another free responsive Jekyll theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing [my first two themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. If you've used my previous themes most of this should be familiar territory.

**Jekyll 3 Update:** A version of HPSTR compatible with Jekyll 3 can be found in the [`jekyll3` branch](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/tree/jekyll3). GitHub Pages is [locked at version 2.4](https://pages.github.com/versions/) so some keep that in mind if you're trying to use 3.0 features that aren't supported there yet.
