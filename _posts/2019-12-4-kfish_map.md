The map is at [G3](https://www.g3journal.org/content/9/9/2851) and go to the [publications](http://jthmiller.github.io/publications/) to check it out.

All of the files to map the ensemble and NCBI genomes are available at the biostudies repo [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST163). The repo contains annotated code for our genotype filtering strategies that vastly improved the final map.

See my publications page for the preprint (menu, top left)
