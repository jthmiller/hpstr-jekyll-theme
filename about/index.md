**Rapid and Local Adaptation to Environmental Pollutants in Killifish**

Humans are rapidly changing the environnmetal conditions that species must adapt to. Populations must respond to the changing environment through physiology and/or evolution. I am interested in this intersection of physiology and evolution, and the genomic responses of natural populations to environmental pollutants. I believe that we can learn a great deal about       



**Osmoregulatory Plasticity in Fish and Coastal Contaminants**

Fish that live in salinity variable environments such as estuaries, or migrate between freshwater and marine environments, most possess a high degree of osmoregulatory plasticity to carry out their normal physiological functions. Salmon, for example, demonstrate osmoregulatory plasticity by reconstructing their gill epithelium when transitioning between freshwater and marine environments to maintain plasma ion homeostasis. If a fish cannot maintain plasma ion homeostasis at the new salinity, systemic stress would ultimately lead to chronic stress or ultimately  death.  

Nano-materials are becoming more prevalent in coastal and estuary environments, and appear to inhibit many of the key pathways that enable gill plasticity in fish. This is especially concerning for those species of fish that either live in contaminated estuaries, or those that rely on gill plasticity to migrate between fresh and marine environments. I am attempting to characterize the impairment of nano-materials, specifically Nano Copper Oxide, on an estuary fish fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic Killifish). Killifish have a well characterized response to environmental salinity and serve as a good model for understanding osmoregulatory function and extreme plasticity in fish.
