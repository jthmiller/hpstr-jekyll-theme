**Rapid and Local Adaptation to Environmental Pollutants in Killifish**
Humans have profoundly changed the conditions of survival for wildlife. In some estuaries, industrial pollution has provided a recent and sharp selective force on aquatic life. Heavy and persistant sediment contamination often leads to the near complete extripation of fish. However, killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) along the Atlantic coast have re-colonized these extremely toxic enivornments through the evolution of a heritable mechanism of resitance to the toxic effects of the pollutants.  

  

I am interested in the adaptive responses at the physiological and evolutionary a
physiology across multiple environments to       


These  respond to the changing environment through physiology and/or evolution. 

I am interested in this intersection of physiology and evolution, and the genomic responses of natural populations to environmental pollutants. I believe that we can learn a great deal about       

**Osmoregulatory Plasticity in Fish and Coastal Contaminants**
Fish actively maintain physiological homeostasis (osmotic pressure) by regulating the concentration ions in their blood plasma.The failure to do so results in chronic, systemic stress or even death. Some fish posess osmoregulatory plasticity, or the ability to change the regulation of these ions in response to environmental variation in their availibility. Fish that live in salinity variable environments such as estuaries, or those that migrate between freshwater and marine environments, must possess a high degree of osmoregulatory plasticity to concentrate or dilute plasma ions to maintain homeostasis. Salmon, for example, demonstrate a high degree of osmoregulatory plasticity by dramatically reconstructing their gill epithelium and activating physiological pathways when transitioning between freshwater and marine environments.  

Nano-materials are becoming more prevalent in coastal and estuary environments, and appear to inhibit many of the key pathways that enable morphological and physiological osmorgegulatory plasticity in fish. This is especially concerning for those species of fish that either live in contaminated estuaries, or those that pass through contaminanted environments during migration. I am attempting to characterize the impairment of nano-materials, specifically Nano Copper Oxide, on an estuary fish fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic Killifish). Killifish have a well characterized response to environmental salinity and serve as a good model for understanding osmoregulatory function, impairment, and extreme plasticity in fish. This work is in collaboration with [Dr. Gary Cherr](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/research/faculty/gary-cherr/) at [Bodega Marine Laboratory](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/) and his participation in the [UC Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology.](http://www.cein.ucla.edu/) 

**Using High-Confidence Local Genome Assembly to Identify Errors in Linkage Mapping**
Many quatitative and population genomic analysis with non-model organisms requires the development of a well assembled reference genome. However, genome assemblies are limited by the ability of short reads to accuratley assemble regions of low complexity. This results in a number high-confidence local assemblies with an unknown relationships or chromosomal locations. Meiotic mapping utilizes linkage between loci to orient the well assembled regions to one another and assigns each to a chromosomal location. However, mapping algorithms tend to treat loci independently, and when confounded with high rates of genotyping error, can lead to poor genome assemblies. I am using the high-evidence based local assembly of Fundulus heteroclitus reduce the missing and errorneous genotypes that can arise from next-gen sequencing and restriction associated digest (RAD tag).
